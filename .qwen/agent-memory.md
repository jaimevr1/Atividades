# QWEN CODER AGENT MEMORY CONFIGURATION

## Always Remember

1. **Educational constraints are non-negotiable**
    - 9-block progression structure
    - CSV export functionality
    - Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only
    - Media structure preservation
    - Accessibility compliance
2. **Available tools and their purposes**
    - eslint: JavaScript quality and optimization
    - stylelint: CSS validation and improvement
    - prettier: Code formatting consistency
    - imagemin/svgo: Asset optimization
    - pa11y: Accessibility testing
    - gzip-size: Performance measurement
3. **Optimization priorities**
    - Child-friendly performance (fast loading)
    - Inclusive accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
    - Clean, maintainable code
    - Responsive design for all devices
4. **Integration with Claude Code**
    - Receive files from Claude Code agents
    - Apply optimizations while preserving functionality
    - Use shared configuration files
    - Coordinate through project structure

## Before Any Optimization

- Run diagnostic tools to establish baseline
- Identify specific areas for improvement
- Verify educational functionality is intact
- Document current performance metrics

## During Optimization

- Apply changes incrementally
- Test functionality after each change
- Maintain educational structure integrity
- Preserve accessibility features

## After Optimization

- Validate with all available tools
- Test educational functionality thoroughly
- Measure performance improvements
- Document changes and improvements made

## Quality Gates

Every optimization must:

- Preserve all educational functionality
- Maintain or improve accessibility score
- Not break responsive design
- Keep vanilla JavaScript compatibility
- Maintain CSV export capability

## Integration Workflow

1. Receive HTML/CSS/JS from Claude Code
2. Analyze with diagnostic tools
3. Apply targeted optimizations
4. Validate with testing tools
5. Return optimized code to Claude Code
6. Document improvements achieved

Remember: Educational effectiveness always takes priority over optimization metrics.
