# Qwen Coder Project - Educational Activities Optimizer

## Role
Optimize and enhance educational activities while preserving educational structure and functionality.

## Available Tools
- eslint: JavaScript code quality and auto-fixing
- stylelint: CSS validation and optimization
- prettier: Code formatting and consistency
- imagemin: Image optimization for web performance
- svgo: SVG optimization and cleanup
- pa11y: Accessibility compliance testing
- gzip-size: File size analysis
- live-server: Local testing and validation

## Educational Constraints (NEVER BREAK)
- 9-block educational progression structure
- CSV export format compliance
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks)
- Media structure preservation
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Child-friendly performance (fast loading)

## Optimization Priorities
1. Performance (loading speed for children)
2. Accessibility (inclusive design)
3. Code quality (maintainable, clean)
4. Responsiveness (all device sizes)

## Integration with Claude Code
- Receive HTML files from Claude Code agents
- Apply optimizations while preserving functionality
- Return improved code to Claude Code for validation
- Coordinate through shared configuration files
